<meta name=keywords content="AppWrite,Supabase,comparison,backend,database,serverless"><meta name=description content="AppWrite vs. Supabase: A Comprehensive Comparison
It&rsquo;s difficult to definitively say one is &ldquo;better&rdquo; than the other, as each has its strengths and is suited for different use cases. However, I can provide a comparison of their key features and performance to help you make an informed decision:
Performance and Scalability
Appwrite consistently outperformed Supabase in stress tests, especially when scaling up to handle more users[1][4]. For example:

On a €5/month self-hosted server, Appwrite handled up to 2,000 users per day comfortably, while Supabase struggled with larger loads[1].
On a more powerful €30/month server, Appwrite managed up to 250 simultaneous users, while Supabase hit its limit at only 45 users[1].
In breakpoint tests, Appwrite reached 6,800 virtual users, processing 100,000 requests with an average 3-second response time. Supabase reached its breakpoint at 3,000 virtual users, with 59,000 requests and a 6-second average response time[4].

Ease of Use

Appwrite offers a smoother self-hosting experience with fewer restrictions and less setup complexity[1][3].
Supabase can be more challenging to configure in a self-hosted environment and has some features restricted or limited when self-hosted[1][3].

Features
Both platforms offer similar core features, including authentication, databases, storage, and serverless functions. However, there are some differences:"><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://novemberde.github.io/post/2024/10/21/appwrite-vs-supabaes/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.min.9f1d947375927e9847272b1f4e9be81336f539e513bf04d52cade31f81cad1af.css integrity="sha256-nx2Uc3WSfphHJysfTpvoEzb1OeUTvwTVLK3jH4HK0a8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.min.2eadbb982468c11a433a3e291f01326f2ba43f065e256bf792dbd79640a92316.js integrity="sha256-Lq27mCRowRpDOj4pHwEybyukPwZeJWv3ktvXlkCpIxY=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=https://novemberde.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://novemberde.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://novemberde.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://novemberde.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://novemberde.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.136.4"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://novemberde.github.io/post/2024/10/21/appwrite-vs-supabaes/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:#1d1e20;--entry:#2e2e33;--primary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.84);--secondary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.56);--tertiary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);--content:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);--hljs-bg:#2e2e33;--code-bg:#37383e;--border:#333}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-9SF4VDQ4N0"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-9SF4VDQ4N0")}</script><meta property="og:title" content="AppWrite vs. Supabase: A Comprehensive Comparison"><meta property="og:description" content="AppWrite vs. Supabase: A Comprehensive Comparison

However, I’ll keep an eye on Appwrite for future projects that require its specific strengths.\nAnd also, friends of mine are using Supabase for their projects and are quite satisfied with its performance and features.
