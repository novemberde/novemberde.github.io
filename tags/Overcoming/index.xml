      <description>&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;burnout&amp;rdquo; is being heard from all directions. It is being expressed as a reason for quitting, changing jobs, taking vacations, and as a way to express difficulties in life. I think everyone has heard it at least once, and I believe there have been times when you&amp;rsquo;ve wondered if you are experiencing burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I hear people talking about burnout, I often feel a deep sense of sympathy, but I also feel that there is little I can do to help. I can suggest various things to try, but those who are experiencing burnout often don&amp;rsquo;t seem to hear those suggestions. So, while contemplating what to do, I decided to write this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
