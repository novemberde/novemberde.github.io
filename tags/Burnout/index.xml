      <description>The word &amp;ldquo;burnout&amp;rdquo; is being heard everywhere. It is being used as a reason for quitting a job, changing jobs, taking a vacation, and expressing difficulties in life.
I think everyone has heard it at least once, and I believe you have thought about whether you are in a state of burnout or not.
When I hear about burnout from others, I often feel a sense of sympathy, but I also feel helpless because there seems to be no way to help them.</description>
