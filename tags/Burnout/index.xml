      <description>The word &amp;ldquo;burnout&amp;rdquo; is being heard from all directions. It is being expressed as a reason for quitting, changing jobs, taking vacations, and as a way to express difficulties in life. I think everyone has heard it at least once, and I believe there have been times when you&amp;rsquo;ve wondered if you are experiencing burnout.
When I hear people talking about burnout, I often feel a deep sense of sympathy, but I also feel that there is little I can do to help.</description>
